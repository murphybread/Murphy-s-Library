# Create a PPT picture of the desired size in prompt

ChatGpt's Dall-E 3 model enables prompt-recognized AI image generation

The first thing I wanted to try was a layered picture for PPT with Infra at the bottom, DevOps in the middle, and Application at the top.

First, it is good for the image atmosphere to declare the style.
I want to architecture for ppt in IT

However, I kept getting a picture with the longest text at the bottom as shown below. Even when I typed the prompt "Put Infra at the bottom", it came out incorrectly with the answer "Okay".
![DALL·E 2024-01-02 21.50.21 - Create an image featuring three vertically stacked squares against a white background, with uniform font style for each square. The bottom square is c.png](/img/user/images/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-01-02%2021.50.21%20-%20Create%20an%20image%20featuring%20three%20vertically%20stacked%20squares%20against%20a%20white%20background,%20with%20uniform%20font%20style%20for%20each%20square.%20The%20bottom%20square%20is%20c.png)



After several attempts, it presented the structure itself.

I created the following image
Application
DevOps
Infra

```
As a result, I was able to achieve the desired composition of the image
