# Library Guidelines

>  In the library, you can find information by following these rules

1. Method of approaching from major to minor categories
The library call numbers are classified as follows:

- 000: Major category `100,200,300 ...`
- 010 Middle category `010,020,030 ...`
- 010.10: Minor category `010.10, 010.20, 010.30 ...`
- 010.10 a: Articles category `010.10 a, 010.10 b, 010.10 c ...`
  
Notes with suffixes like"a" represent articles containing content, while other identifiers denote a range.
You can view all notes call numbers at once
[[Projects/Library/Call Number Index\|Call Number Index]]



2. Method through search
- Search using contents, tags, numbers  related to the content or category range.
Each note is connected only to the preceding and following ones.

**Example (ex):**
100 note is connected hompage and 110,120,130, ...
