{"dg-publish":true,"description":"\"Triplane Meets Gaussian Splatting\" introduces an efficient 3D reconstruction method from single images using transformer-based networks for rapid feed-forward inference. The approach combines a point decoder and a triplane decoder, leveraging a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian representation for fast rendering and high-quality results. This hybrid design outperforms existing methods in speed and quality by balancing between implicit and explicit 3D representatio.","permalink":"/projects/library/700/720/720-20/720-20-c/","dgPassFrontmatter":true,"noteIcon":"0","created":"2024-05-07T14:58:30.014+09:00","updated":"2024-06-20T03:48:39.229+09:00"}

매우빠름 A10G 기준 한 30초 되는듯.

근데 역시 이미지의 안 보이는 면이 아쉬움

근데 화질이나 질감 빛차이가 덜할수록 오브젝트로 만들어질때는 쉬운듯? 테스트필요
