# Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
359 papers with code • 3 benchmarks • 8 datasets

The target of **Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning** is to solve complex problems by integrating multiple agents that focus on different sub-tasks. In general, there are two types of multi-agent systems: independent and cooperative systems.

# Domain Generalization

567 papers with code • 19 benchmarks • 24 datasets

The idea of **Domain Generalization** is to learn from one or multiple training domains, to extract a domain-agnostic model which can be applied to an unseen domain
