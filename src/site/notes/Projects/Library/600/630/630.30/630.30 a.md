Checking sagemaker iam role, default sagemaker user role has no bedrock related policies.
grant bedrock fullaccess
->still get access error



Looking again, I see that the first sagemaker image mentions data science 3.0 image conditions.
Navigated to the ECR image domain to use that image. so I could download it directly to my sagemaker environment.
But couldn't find it

so thought of creating ecr and uploading it myself
So I tried sagemaker sdk, but it doesn't show the domain if I use url

I thought about using a Jupyter instance, but it doesn't have a linkchain.

Solved
Allow model access in the console first
Add that setting when you want to use it locally
