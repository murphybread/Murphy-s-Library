# Create a PPT picture of the desired size in prompt

ChatGPT's Dall-E 3 model enables prompt-recognized AI image generation

The first thing I wanted to try was a layered picture for PPT with Infra at the bottom, DevOps in the middle, and Application at the top.

First, it is good for the image atmosphere to declare the style.

However, I kept getting a picture with the longest text at the bottom as shown below. Even when I typed the prompt "Put Infra at the bottom", it came out incorrectly with the answer "Okay".

After several attempts, it presented the structure itself.
```
I created the following image
Application
DevOps
Infra

```
As a result, I was able to achieve the desired composition of the image

# Problems
`When you want to give ChatGPT the role of creating posts that fit your desired structure, but they don't follow your desired structure`

I tried to write an article with a set structure through ChatGPT, but ChatGPT said yes, but didn't create the structure I wanted.

Here is role what i used
```

Your role is to assist users in creating IT-related blog articles. When provided with a conversation between the user and ChatGPT, you will write an article using the information provided, formatted in Markdown.
When you get not english conversation, first translate it and Please use the following format as a guide
 Your articles should follow a specific structure: 
You must adhere to a 3-line summary of the TLDR, a 3-line summary of the problem, and a 3-line summary of the solution

before write start, think about format rule and markdown format

**TL;DR**: Summarize the problem definition, the solution approach, and the benefits and limitations of the solution. Summarize 3. lines as far as possible
1.Describe how you defined the problem, usually in some context.
2. Describe your approach to solving that problem and how you solved it.
3. Describe the benefits and limitations of solving the problem.

 **Problem**: Provide a detailed definition of the problem, the context in which it occurs, and the benefits of solving it.
`Define what the problem is, usually in the form of a one-line summary`
Describe the problem in more detail, the context in which you encounter it, and the benefits of solving it.

 **Solution**: Describe the approach to solving the problem, including a technical introduction or example, and illustrate how the solution addresses the original problem.
`How to resolve this issue`
An approach to solve that problem first
A technical introduction or example in the middle
At the end, a situation where the solution solved the original problem

You should emphasize clarity and accuracy in conveying technical information. Your responses should be well-structured and adhere strictly to the provided format. It's important to ensure that the content is informative and relevant to IT professionals and enthusiasts.
```

Main points are here
```
You must adhere to a 3-line summary of the TLDR, a 3-line summary of the problem, and a 3-line summary of the solution

before write start, think about format rule and markdown format
**TL;DR**: Summarize the problem definition, the solution approach, and the benefits and limitations of the solution. Summarize 3. lines as far as possible
1.Describe how you defined the problem, usually in some context.
2. Describe your approach to solving that problem and how you solved it.
3. Describe the benefits and limitations of solving the problem.
```


# Solution
'If the structure is formed by the preceding command, the structure for subsequent commands can be ignored'.

There are other structures, but the TL DR's 3-line summary was the only one that I could see that I wasn't breaking, and that I could see clearly.
I tried translating it into a foreign language, adding structure after translation, and adding prompts to emphasize structure, but it didn't work.

I thought maybe the previous command was making the next one disappear, so I removed the previous command and specified exactly what I wanted it to look like

This solution gave me the structure I wanted.
Here is modified role explanation
```

**TL;DR**
1.Describe how you defined the problem, usually in some context.
2. Describe your approach to solving that problem and how you solved it.
3. Describe the benefits and limitations of solving the problem.
