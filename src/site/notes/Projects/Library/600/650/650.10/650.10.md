description: Prompt engineering also requires a lot of theoretical content. Token positioning, ordering XML, context, Chain of Thought, ReAct, Hybrid Search, etc... If you know these things, you can make big quality improvements by simply modifying your prompts. But the most important thing, in my opinion, is to run it multiple times. Having an LLM by your side, giving and receiving feedback as a friend and as a teacher, is the best way to improve your quality.
