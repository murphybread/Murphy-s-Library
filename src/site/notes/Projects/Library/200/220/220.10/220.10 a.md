## Audience

## Overview
GitLab issue templates (v16.11)

There are no issue templates, but there are issue description templates.

It is provided as an md file in the `.gitlab/issue_templates` path and can be used by default when used as `Default.md` (premium and above)
Additionally, you can share a specific template within a group and make it available to all projects in the group (premium and above)
Special commands like `/` can be used to assign labels or assigned within an issue.


Labeling is not dynamic. Different labels for different authors.
You need to run webhooks or pipelines separately.
