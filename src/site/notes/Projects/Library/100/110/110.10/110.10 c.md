{"dg-publish":true,"description":"To explain helm, it's a way of managing Kubernetes resources in a package, because it's hard to manage multiple commands every time, every time in different environments, so we make it into code. It's a kind of Kubernetes IaC (Infrastructure as Code), so the minimum requirement is that you have a Kubernetes cluster running and have knowledge about that.","permalink":"/projects/library/100/110/110-10/110-10-c/","dgPassFrontmatter":true,"noteIcon":"0","created":"2024-04-25T17:09:16.975+09:00","updated":"2024-06-20T02:02:30.991+09:00"}

Chart is a Helm package. It contains all the resource definitions needed to run applications, tools, and services inside a Kubernetes cluster. You can think of it as the equivalent of a Homebrew formula, Apt dpkg, or YUM RPM file in Kubernetes.

A _repository_ is a place to collect and share charts. This is like Perl's [CPAN archive] (https://www.cpan.org/) or [Fedora Package Database] (https://src.fedoraproject.org/), but for Kubernetes packages.

A _release_ is an instance of a chart running on a Kubernetes cluster. Typically, a chart can be installed multiple times in the same cluster. Each time it is installed, a new _release_ is created.



# Install helm
```
# Download helm
    - echo "start helm download"
    - curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
    - chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    - ./get_helm.sh
    - helm version
    - echo "finish helm download"
```



# helm uninstall
get `release_name` and `namespace_name`
`helm list -A`

(Example) Releas name is `my-argo` , namespace name is `argocd-ns`
```bash

NAME   	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                                	STATUS  	CHART         	APP VERSION
my-argo	argocd-ns  	1       	2024-04-26 01:02:09.175995975 +0000 UTC	deployed	argo-cd-6.7.15	v2.10.7
```

`helm uninstall <release_name> -n <namespace_name>`


# Helm upgrade
After you change values.yaml or service.yaml or etc,  You have to notify it to helm



`helm upgrade <release-name> <helm file path> -n <namespace name>`

ex)
`some_path/fastapi`
```
ls -l

helm list -n test

```

helm upgrade command
`helm upgrade my-release ./myfastapiapp -n test`
