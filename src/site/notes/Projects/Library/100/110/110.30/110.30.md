description: It is a GCP run by Google, one of the public clouds. Currently, it is characterized by low domestic and market share, so it is difficult to get references. However, as it is operated by Google, which created Kubernetes, the resources and settings related to Kubernetes are excellent, and the BIG QUERY service is especially good. GCP aim for full managed service, so simple  using is convenient but custom is hard.
