What is that credential way `credsStore`. this 
```
image: alpine
stages:
  - build_and_push
build and push docker image:
  stage: build_and_push
  variables: 
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: ap-northeast-2
    CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE: 123456784321.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/appname
  image:
    name: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:debug
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    -  mkdir -p /kaniko/.docker
    -  echo "{\"credsStore\":\"ecr-login\"}" > /kaniko/.docker/config.json
    -  /kaniko/executor
      --context "${CI_PROJECT_DIR}"
      --dockerfile "${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/Dockerfile"
      --destination "${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:${CI_COMMIT_TAG}"
```


credsStore is some external helper for saving data securely. So we don't have to save secure data in yaml. 
My guess Kaniko has already install helpers for this process, So this image doesn't has to install eks command.

Kubernetes 1.29 now create record correctly. but 1.28 create correct
even ingress success, and pod log say It's ok.
No Clue
