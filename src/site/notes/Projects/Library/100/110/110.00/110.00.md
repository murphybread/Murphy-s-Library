description: We now have a technology called Docker that allows us to build environments quickly and easily. It's an evolution of virtualization going back a long way, and while the speed is an advantage, my personal favorite is that it provides a consistent environment. It is possible to guarantee and share dev, stage, production environments, excluding external environments, and later manage them in the form of IaC. I think this is the reason why Docker is so popular, widely used, and evolving.
