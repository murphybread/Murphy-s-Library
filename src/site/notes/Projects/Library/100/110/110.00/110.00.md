{"dg-publish":true,"description":"We now have a technology called Docker that allows us to build environments quickly and easily. It's an evolution of virtualization going back a long way, and while the speed is an advantage, my personal favorite is that it provides a consistent environment whatever dev or prod. It is possible to guarantee and share dev, stage, production environments, excluding external environments, and later manage them in the form of IaC. I think this is the reason why Docker is so popular, widely used, and evolving.","permalink":"/projects/library/100/110/110-00/110-00/","dgPassFrontmatter":true,"noteIcon":"0","created":"2024-04-23T20:45:21.789+09:00","updated":"2024-06-20T01:56:56.932+09:00"}
