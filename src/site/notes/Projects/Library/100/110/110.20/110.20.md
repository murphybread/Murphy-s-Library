description: AWS is a public cloud. The main reason for using the largest cloud is to have elastic resources. I can easily rent a 10,000 dollars server or a 100,000 dollars server by the hour. It's good for small businesses because it can support company-level scale and performance. However, as the scale grows and the network becomes more complex, using the cloud can become a poison. As always, it's important to use it in moderation.
