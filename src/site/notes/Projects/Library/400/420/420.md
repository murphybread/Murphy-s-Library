{"dg-publish":true,"description":"We cover data that we believe accounts for 70% of the total process of ML. For example, if we are a chef, we cook meat that is already packaged. But the meat is produced, transported, and processed into different cuts. Depending on the cut, we have to take care of everythings. expensive, cheap, tough, etc. So there's a lot of work that goes into getting that meat to the point where we can cook it, and that's where the data comes in.","permalink":"/projects/library/400/420/420/","dgPassFrontmatter":true,"noteIcon":"0","created":"2024-01-30T20:06:19.625+09:00","updated":"2024-04-11T00:48:19.216+09:00"}
