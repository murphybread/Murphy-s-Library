Methods for Optimization


Derivative, Minimum, and Least Error in Quadratic Functions

Derivative
Instantaneous rate of change, lim deltax -> 0

Partial differentiation
Treat values other than specific variables as constants

Derivative Laws
ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative

Backpropagation
Laws and Multiplication Rules
When the output changes by 1, what happens to the input?
The legal rule flows as it is, while the multiplicative rule flows into the changed value
