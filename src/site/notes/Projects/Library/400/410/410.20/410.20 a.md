#Probability
 Infer the probability distribution of a parameter from a finite number of data -> It is difficult to know exactly the true probability distribution, and approximate it.
 
 If the structure and number of models change flexibly depending on the data, nonparametric
 
 - A Representative example - Binary data -> Bernoulli distribution
 - More than n discrete values -> category distribution 
 - Data value between 0 and 1 -> Beta distribution 
 - Data values above 0 -> Gamma distribution, Log normal distribution 
 - If the data has values throughout R -> Normal distribution Laplace distribution
