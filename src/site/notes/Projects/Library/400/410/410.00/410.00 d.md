### Addition and subtraction[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Addition and subtraction")]

The addition may be represented graphically by placing the tail of the arrow **b** at the head of the arrow **a**, and then drawing an arrow from the tail of **a** to the head of **b**. The new arrow drawn represents the vector **a** + **b**, as 



Subtraction of two vectors can be geometrically illustrated as follows: to subtract **b** from **a**, place the tails of **a** and **b** at the same point, and then draw an arrow from the head of **b** to the head of **a**. This new arrow represents the vector **(-b)** + **a**, with **(-b)** being the opposite of **b**, see drawing. And **(-b)** + **a** = **a** - **b**.




# Vector multiplication: Dot product
The dot product of two vectors a and b (sometimes called the inner product, or, since its result is a scalar, the scalar product) is denoted by a . b, and is defined as:



The dot product can also be defined as the sum of the products of the components of each vector as


# Vector multiplication: Cross product
The _cross product_ (also called the _vector product_ or _outer product_) is only meaningful in three or [seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-dimensional_cross_product "Seven-dimensional cross product") dimensions. The cross product differs from the dot product primarily in that the result of the cross product of two vectors is a vector. The cross product, denoted **a** x **b**, is a vector perpendicular to both **a** and **b** and is defined as
