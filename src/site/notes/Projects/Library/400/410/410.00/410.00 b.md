Turning data into numbers for easy interpretation and manipulation

Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors

Scalars
Zero-dimensional numeric values

Vectors
Size and direction, one dimensional
Unit vector size of 1

Position vector
A vector whose starting point is the origin

Zero vector
has size 0 and all directions are 0
Why it's needed: because the intersection of two subspaces (subsets of a vector space) always results in a subspace.
