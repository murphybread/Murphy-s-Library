First-order functions
y =ax+b (a != 0)
Slope and intercept

Quadratic function
y=ax^2 (a != 0)
	a>0 , a<0 

Exponential function
y=a^x (a!=1, a>0)
a >1 , 0<a<1

Logarithmic function
y=loga x (x>0, a!=1, a>0)
Relationship between exponential and inverse functions

Sigmoid function
y = 1 / (1+e^-x)
Logistic regression
y = 1 / (1+e^-(ax+b)) Steepens when a slope is large, shifts left or right when b is large
Uses: Easy to binary categorize output into 0s and 1s, nonlinear functions
