# Basic terms in probability include:

1. **Probability**: Measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
2. **Experiment**: A procedure or action that results in one or more outcomes, like tossing a coin.
3. **Outcome**: The result of a single trial of an experiment.
4. **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
5. **Event**: A specific outcome or a set of outcomes of an experiment.
6. **Random Variable**: A variable whose values depend on the outcomes of a random phenomenon.
7. **Probability Distribution**: Describes how probabilities are distributed over the values of the random variable.
8. **Expected Value**: The average value of a random variable over many repetitions of the experiment.
9. **Variance**: Measure of how much the values of a random variable vary from its expected value.
10. **Independent Events**: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.
