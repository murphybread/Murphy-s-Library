#Colab


Breaking, cutting, and splitting cells SPLIT is CTRL + M + '-'
'-' is the dash on the keyboard above the numpad
However, CTRL+M is itself a markdown command, so if you don't press M +'-' almost simultaneously, CTRL+M will be done first and the cell will not be split, but the cell will be turned into markdown and that may be the end of it
