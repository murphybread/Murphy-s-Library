```css
border-radius: [pixel or percentage]
border: [border-width] [border-style] [border-color];
```

### The number of property values determines which corners are applied
Applies to all corners if there is one attribute

Rectangular elements can be circular when set to 50%.

## border

### Many properties are available, consult them as required.
