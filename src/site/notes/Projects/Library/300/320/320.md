description: Let's talk about the frontend of your application. In my opinion, the frontend is like the face of a person. Of course, personality, tone of voice, etc. are important, but you can't ignore the importance of the face, right? So it is an important role that directly affects UX. So I personally want you to consider the interface for users, not just technical.
