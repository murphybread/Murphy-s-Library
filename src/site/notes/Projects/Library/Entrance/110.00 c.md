{"dg-publish":true,"description":"This is the method to use when you want to use multiple images when using Docker and reduce the final image to a compact size.  For example, if you install a 500MB package in the first stage and the output is 10MB, and you don't need to use that 500MB in the final stage when you're only using the output, this is the technique to use.","permalink":"/projects/library/entrance/110-00-c/","dgPassFrontmatter":true,"noteIcon":"0","created":"2024-04-30T10:36:31.574+09:00","updated":"2024-04-30T10:43:37.169+09:00"}

# Dockerfile
```
# First Stage Approximately Node image has 330MB
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

# Second Stage Approximately Alpine image has 5MB
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# The final built image is 5MB + output of first Stage

```

`WORKDIR`  will create folder if you don't have. But when using multi-stage, it will deleted in next stage.
