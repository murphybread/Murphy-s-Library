# How can I easily manage multiple git projects?
#git_submodule


## Audience
 Users who want to manage multiple sub-projects within a single main project.

## Features
Sub-projects are managed as files within submodules, using the 'git submodule' command.
Subprojects and the main project will each have their own git project, and will be managed separately from the main project
Submodules are manged by .gitmodules file

## Usage
Here's a situation where you have a main project and a subproject, and you want to connect the two projects through a submodule

Add submodule-specific information to a main project that doesn't have any submodules
`git submodule add <git-submodule-url> <main-project-path>` 

Set submodule-specific information locally with this commands
`git submodule init`

get directory sub module
`git submoudle update` 

Update git submodule files
** Submodules are managed independently from the main project. So you have to do update manualy **
`git submodule update --remote`
