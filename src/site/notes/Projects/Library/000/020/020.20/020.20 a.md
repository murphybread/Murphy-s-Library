# Proper dividing for reusable modules
#Module #methodology 


## Audience
For who considered about what is proper dividing standard for making module
## Overview

I make class for milvus. Because some features were not properly worked, So I had to create it. 
After I create , I was stuck in
` how to package it.`

There is no relationship Basic RAG.py and new milvus.py initially.
But I have to import it. It is easy if just import it.
However if I import without thinking, some dependencies problem can occur.
