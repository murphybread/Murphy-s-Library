It says; the **3rd** public release, at around the **24th week of 2019**, from build **59**.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/line/headver#introduction)

a version specification that has `{head}.{yearweek}.{build}` system.

The name `HeadVer` stands for **"only head number is enough to maintain!"** because it only allows to set the first number manually, and rest numbers are automatic. It simplifies `x.y.z` versioning and gurantees incremental version stamping on top of various versioning scripts introduced in this repository. HeadVer versioning system is battle-tested on the 40+ app/web services.

- `{head}` - manual. Zero-based number.
- `{yearweek}` - automatic. 2-digit for year and 2-digit for week number.
- `{build}` - automatic. Incremental number from a build server.
