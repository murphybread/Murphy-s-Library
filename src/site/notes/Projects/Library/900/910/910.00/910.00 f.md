description: You may have heard that modelling is only 30% of AI ML, but you may not understand what that means, so I'd like to use a holistic analogy to talk about this flow. Let's say the modeller is a chef and the beef is the data. Before we can cook it, the beef has to be raised by a farmer, transported by a delivery driver, and disassembled by a butcher before we can cook it. So we think that understanding the AI ML pipeline is understanding where and how the data, the beef, gets from here to there before we use it. So the analogy is that good data, expensive meat, leads to good results, delicious food.
